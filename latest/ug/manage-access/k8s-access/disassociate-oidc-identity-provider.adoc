= Disassociate an [.noloc]`OIDC` identity provider from your cluster
:info_titleabbrev: Unlink OIDC provider

include::../../attributes.txt[]

If you disassociate an [.noloc]`OIDC` identity provider from your cluster, users included in the provider can no longer access the cluster. However, you can still access the cluster with   link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-principal[IAM principals,type="documentation"].

. Open the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].
. In the *[.noloc]`OIDC` Identity Providers* section, select  *Disassociate*, enter the identity provider name, and then select `Disassociate`.
