= Disassociate an OIDC identity provider from your cluster
:info_titleabbrev: Unlink OIDC provider

If you disassociate an OIDC identity provider from your cluster, users included in the provider can no longer access the cluster. However, you can still access the cluster with link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-principal[IAM principals,type="documentation"].

. Open the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].
. In the *OIDC Identity Providers* section, select *Disassociate*, enter the identity provider name, and then select `Disassociate`.
