= Disable `IPv6` in the EKS Pod Identity Agent
:info_titleabbrev: Disable IPv6

include::../../attributes.txt[]

[#pod-id-console]
== {aws-management-console}
. To disable `IPv6` in the EKS Pod Identity Agent, add the following configuration to the *Optional configuration settings* of the EKS Add-on.
+
.. Open the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].
.. In the left navigation pane, select *Clusters*, and then select the name of the cluster that you want to configure the add-on for.
.. Choose the *Add-ons* tab.
.. Select the box in the top right of the EKS Pod Identity Agent add-on box and then choose *Edit*.
.. On the *Configure EKS Pod Identity Agent* page:
+
... Select the *Version* that you'd like to use. We recommend that you keep the same version as the previous step, and update the version and configuration in separate actions.
... Expand the *Optional configuration settings*.
... Enter the JSON key `"agent":` and value of a nested JSON object with a key `"additionalArgs":` in *Configuration values*. The resulting text must be a valid JSON object. If this key and value are the only data in the text box, surround the key and value with curly braces `{ }`. The following example shows network policy is enabled:
+
[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{
    "agent": {
        "additionalArgs": {
            "-b": "169.254.170.23"
        }
    }
}
----
+
This configuration sets the `IPv4` address to be the only address used by the agent.
.. To apply the new configuration by replacing the EKS Pod Identity Agent pods, choose *Save changes*.
+
Amazon EKS applies changes to the EKS Add-ons by using a _rollout_ of the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` `DaemonSet` for EKS Pod Identity Agent. You can track the status of the rollout in the *Update history* of the add-on in the {aws-management-console} and with `kubectl rollout status daemonset/eks-pod-identity-agent --namespace kube-system`.
+
`kubectl rollout` has the following commands:
+
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ kubectl rollout
                            
history  -- View rollout history
pause    -- Mark the provided resource as paused
restart  -- Restart a resource
resume   -- Resume a paused resource
status   -- Show the status of the rollout
undo     -- Undo a previous rollout
----
+
If the rollout takes too long, Amazon EKS will undo the rollout, and a message with the type of *Addon Update* and a status of *Failed* will be added to the *Update history* of the add-on. To investigate any issues, start from the history of the rollout, and run `kubectl logs` on a EKS Pod Identity Agent pod to see the logs of EKS Pod Identity Agent.
. If the new entry in the *Update history* has a status of *Successful*, then the rollout has completed and the add-on is using the new configuration in all of the EKS Pod Identity Agent pods.

[#pod-id-cli]
== {aws} CLI
. To disable `IPv6` in the EKS Pod Identity Agent, add the following configuration to the *configuration values* of the EKS Add-on.
+
Run the following {aws} CLI command. Replace `my-cluster` with the name of your cluster and the IAM role ARN with the role that you are using.
+
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
aws eks update-addon --cluster-name my-cluster --addon-name eks-pod-identity-agent \
    --resolve-conflicts PRESERVE --configuration-values '{"agent":{"additionalArgs": { "-b": "169.254.170.23"}}}'
----
+
This configuration sets the `IPv4` address to be the only address used by the agent.
