Learn how Amazon EKS manages external communication for [.noloc]`Pods` using Source Network Address Translation (SNAT), allowing Pods to access internet resources or networks connected via VPC peering, Transit Gateway, or {aws} Direct Connect.
--

*Applies to*: [.noloc]`Linux` `IPv4` Fargate nodes, [.noloc]`Linux` nodes with Amazon EC2 instances  

If you deployed your cluster using the `IPv6` family, then the information in this topic isn't applicable to your cluster, because `IPv6` addresses are not network translated. For more information about using `IPv6` with your cluster, see <<cni-ipv6>>.

By default, each [.noloc]`Pod` in your cluster is assigned a link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-private-addresses[private,type="documentation"] `IPv4` address from a classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) block that is associated with the VPC that the [.noloc]`Pod` is deployed in. [.noloc]`Pods` in the same VPC communicate with each other using these private IP addresses as end points. When a [.noloc]`Pod` communicates to any `IPv4` address that isn't within a CIDR block that's associated to your VPC, the Amazon VPC CNI plugin (for both https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s#amazon-vpc-cni-k8s[Linux] or https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-plugins/tree/master/plugins/vpc-bridge[Windows]) translates the [.noloc]`Pod's` `IPv4` address to the primary private `IPv4` address of the primary link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#eni-basics[elastic network interface,type="documentation"] of the node that the [.noloc]`Pod` is running on, by default <<snat-exception,*>>.

[NOTE]
====

For [.noloc]`Windows` nodes, there are additional details to consider. By default, the https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-plugins/tree/master/plugins/vpc-bridge[VPC CNI plugin for Windows] is defined with a networking configuration in which the traffic to a destination within the same VPC is excluded for SNAT. This means that internal VPC communication has SNAT disabled and the IP address allocated to a [.noloc]`Pod` is routable inside the VPC. But traffic to a destination outside of the VPC has the source [.noloc]`Pod` IP SNAT'ed to the instance ENI's primary IP address. This default configuration for [.noloc]`Windows` ensures that the pod can access networks outside of your VPC in the same way as the host instance.

====

Due to this behavior:

* Your [.noloc]`Pods` can communicate with internet resources only if the node that they're running on has a link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses[public,type="documentation"] or link:vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html[elastic,type="documentation"] IP address assigned to it and is in a link:vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html#subnet-basics[public subnet,type="documentation"]. A public subnet's associated link:vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html[route table,type="documentation"] has a route to an internet gateway. We recommend deploying nodes to private subnets, whenever possible.
* For versions of the plugin earlier than `1.8.0`, resources that are in networks or VPCs that are connected to your cluster VPC using link:vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html[VPC peering,type="documentation"], a link:whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/transit-vpc-option.html[transit VPC,type="documentation"], or link:directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html[{aws} Direct Connect,type="documentation"] can't initiate communication to your [.noloc]`Pods` behind secondary elastic network interfaces. Your [.noloc]`Pods` can initiate communication to those resources and receive responses from them, though.

If either of the following statements are true in your environment, then change the default configuration with the command that follows.

* You have resources in networks or VPCs that are connected to your cluster VPC using link:vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html[VPC peering,type="documentation"], a link:whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/transit-vpc-option.html[transit VPC,type="documentation"], or link:directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html[{aws} Direct Connect,type="documentation"] that need to initiate communication with your [.noloc]`Pods` using an `IPv4` address and your plugin version is earlier than `1.8.0`.
* Your [.noloc]`Pods` are in a link:vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html#subnet-basics[private subnet,type="documentation"] and need to communicate outbound to the internet. The subnet has a route to a link:vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateway,type="documentation"].

[NOTE]
====

The `AWS_VPC_K8S_CNI_EXTERNALSNAT` and `AWS_VPC_K8S_CNI_EXCLUDE_SNAT_CIDRS` CNI configuration variables aren't applicable to [.noloc]`Windows` nodes. Disabling SNAT isn't supported for [.noloc]`Windows`. As for excluding a list of `IPv4` CIDRs from SNAT, you can define this by specifying the `ExcludedSnatCIDRs` parameter in the [.noloc]`Windows` bootstrap script. For more information on using this parameter, see <<bootstrap-script-configuration-parameters>>.

[#snat-exception]
== Host networking

{asterisk} If a [.noloc]`Pod's` spec contains `hostNetwork=true` (default is `false`), then its IP address isn't translated to a different address. This is the case for the `kube-proxy` and [.noloc]`Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes` [.noloc]`Pods` that run on your cluster, by default. For these [.noloc]`Pods`, the IP address is the same as the node's primary IP address, so the [.noloc]`Pod's` IP address isn't translated. For more information about a [.noloc]`Pod's` `hostNetwork` setting, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v{k8s-n}/#podspec-v1-core[PodSpec v1 core] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API reference.
