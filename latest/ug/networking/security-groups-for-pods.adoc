Learn how to configure security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` on Amazon EKS, integrating Amazon EC2 security groups with [.noloc]`Kubernetes` [.noloc]`Pods` to define network traffic rules. Discover the considerations, setup process, and deploy a sample application with assigned security groups.

*Applies to*: [.noloc]`Linux` nodes with Amazon EC2 instances  

*Applies to*: Private subnets

Security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` integrate Amazon EC2 security groups with [.noloc]`Kubernetes` [.noloc]`Pods`. You can use Amazon EC2 security groups to define rules that allow inbound and outbound network traffic to and from [.noloc]`Pods` that you deploy to nodes running on many Amazon EC2 instance types and Fargate. For a detailed explanation of this capability, see the link:containers/introducing-security-groups-for-pods[Introducing security groups for Pods,type="blog"] blog post.

== Compatibility with [.noloc]`Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes` features

You can use security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` with the following features:



* IPv4 Source Network Address Translation - For more information, see <<external-snat>>.
* IPv6 addresses to clusters, Pods, and services - For more information, see <<cni-ipv6>>.
* Restricting traffic using [.noloc]`Kubernetes` network policies - For more information, see <<cni-network-policy>>.

== Considerations

Before deploying security groups for [.noloc]`Pods`, consider the following limitations and conditions:



* Security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` can't be used with [.noloc]`Windows` nodes.
* Security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` can be used with clusters configured for the `IPv6` family that contain Amazon EC2 nodes by using version 1.16.0 or later of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin. You can use security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` with clusters configure `IPv6` family that contain only Fargate nodes by using version 1.7.7 or later of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin. For more information, see <<cni-ipv6>>
* Security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` are supported by most   link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances[Nitro-based,type="documentation"] Amazon EC2 instance families, though not by all generations of a family. For example, the `m5`, `c5`, `r5`, `m6g`, `c6g`, and `r6g` instance family and generations are supported. No instance types in the `t` family are supported. For a complete list of supported instance types, see the https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-resource-controller-k8s/blob/v1.5.0/pkg/aws/vpc/limits.go[limits.go] file on [.noloc]`GitHub`. Your nodes must be one of the listed instance types that have `IsTrunkingCompatible: true` in that file.
* If you're also using [.noloc]`Pod` security policies to restrict access to [.noloc]`Pod` mutation, then the `eks:vpc-resource-controller` [.noloc]`Kubernetes` user must be specified in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` `ClusterRoleBinding` for the `role` that your `psp` is assigned to. If you're using the default Amazon EKS `psp`, `role`, and `ClusterRoleBinding`, this is the `eks:podsecuritypolicy:authenticated` `ClusterRoleBinding`. For example, you add the user to the `subjects:` section, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
[...]
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    name: system:authenticated
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: User
    name: eks:vpc-resource-controller
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: eks-vpc-resource-controller
----
* If you're using custom networking and security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` together, the security group specified by security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` is used instead of the security group specified in the `ENIConfig`.
* If you're using version `1.10.2` or earlier of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin and you include the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` setting in your [.noloc]`Pod` spec, the value for the setting can't be zero.  
* If you're using version `1.10` or earlier of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin, or version `1.11` with `POD_SECURITY_GROUP_ENFORCING_MODE`=``strict``, which is the default setting, then [.noloc]`Kubernetes` services of type `NodePort` and `LoadBalancer` using instance targets with an `externalTrafficPolicy` set to `Local` aren't supported with [.noloc]`Pods` that you assign security groups to. For more information about using a load balancer with instance targets, see <<network-load-balancing>>.
* If you're using version `1.10` or earlier of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin or version `1.11` with `POD_SECURITY_GROUP_ENFORCING_MODE`=``strict``, which is the default setting, source NAT is disabled for outbound traffic from [.noloc]`Pods` with assigned security groups so that outbound security group rules are applied. To access the internet, [.noloc]`Pods` with assigned security groups must be launched on nodes that are deployed in a private subnet configured with a NAT gateway or instance. [.noloc]`Pods` with assigned security groups deployed to public subnets are not able to access the internet.
+
If you're using version `1.11` or later of the plugin with `POD_SECURITY_GROUP_ENFORCING_MODE`=``standard``, then [.noloc]`Pod` traffic destined for outside of the VPC is translated to the IP address of the instance's primary network interface. For this traffic, the rules in the security groups for the primary network interface are used, rather than the rules in the [.noloc]`Pod's` security groups.  
* To use [.noloc]`Calico` network policy with [.noloc]`Pods` that have associated security groups, you must use version `1.11.0` or later of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin and set `POD_SECURITY_GROUP_ENFORCING_MODE`=``standard``. Otherwise, traffic flow to and from [.noloc]`Pods` with associated security groups are not subjected to [.noloc]`Calico` network policy enforcement and are limited to Amazon EC2 security group enforcement only. To update your Amazon VPC CNI version, see <<managing-vpc-cni>>
* [.noloc]`Pods` running on Amazon EC2 nodes that use security groups in clusters that use https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/nodelocaldns/[NodeLocal DNSCache] are only supported with version `1.11.0` or later of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin and with `POD_SECURITY_GROUP_ENFORCING_MODE`=``standard``. To update your Amazon VPC CNI plugin version, see <<managing-vpc-cni>>
* Security groups for [.noloc]`Pods` might lead to higher [.noloc]`Pod` startup latency for [.noloc]`Pods` with high churn. This is due to rate limiting in the resource controller.
* The EC2 security group scope is at the [.noloc]`Pod`-level - For more information, see   link:vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html[Security group,type="documentation"].
+
If you set `POD_SECURITY_GROUP_ENFORCING_MODE=standard` and `AWS_VPC_K8S_CNI_EXTERNALSNAT=false`, traffic destined for endpoints outside the VPC use the node's security groups, not the [.noloc]`Pod's` security groups.
