= Create the [.noloc]`CoreDNS` Amazon EKS add-on
:info_titleabbrev: Create

include::../attributes.txt[]

Create the [.noloc]`CoreDNS` Amazon EKS add-on. You must have a cluster before you create the add-on. For more information, see <<create-cluster>>.

. See which version of the add-on is installed on your cluster.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl describe deployment coredns --namespace kube-system | grep coredns: | cut -d : -f 3
----
+
An example output is as follows.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
v1.10.1-eksbuild.13
----
. See which type of the add-on is installed on your cluster. Depending on the tool that you created your cluster with, you might not currently have the Amazon EKS add-on type installed on your cluster. Replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your cluster.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
aws eks describe-addon --cluster-name my-cluster --addon-name coredns --query addon.addonVersion --output text
----
+
If a version number is returned, you have the Amazon EKS type of the add-on installed on your cluster and don't need to complete the remaining steps in this procedure. If an error is returned, you don't have the Amazon EKS type of the add-on installed on your cluster. Complete the remaining steps of this procedure to install it.
. Save the configuration of your currently installed add-on.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get deployment coredns -n kube-system -o yaml > aws-k8s-coredns-old.yaml
----
. Create the add-on using the {aws} CLI. If you want to use the {aws-management-console} or `eksctl` to create the add-on, see <<creating-an-add-on>> and specify `coredns` for the add-on name. Copy the command that follows to your device. Make the following modifications to the command, as needed, and then run the modified command.
+
** Replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your cluster.
** Replace [.replaceable]`v1.11.3-eksbuild.1` with the latest version listed in the <<coredns-versions,latest version table>> for your cluster version.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
aws eks create-addon --cluster-name my-cluster --addon-name coredns --addon-version v1.11.3-eksbuild.1
----
+
If you've applied custom settings to your current add-on that conflict with the default settings of the Amazon EKS add-on, creation might fail. If creation fails, you receive an error that can help you resolve the issue. Alternatively, you can add `--resolve-conflicts OVERWRITE` to the previous command. This allows the add-on to overwrite any existing custom settings. Once you've created the add-on, you can update it with your custom settings.
. Confirm that the latest version of the add-on for your cluster's [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version was added to your cluster. Replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your cluster.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
aws eks describe-addon --cluster-name my-cluster --addon-name coredns --query addon.addonVersion --output text
----
+
It might take several seconds for add-on creation to complete.
+
An example output is as follows.
+
[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
v1.11.3-eksbuild.1
----
. If you made custom settings to your original add-on, before you created the Amazon EKS add-on, use the configuration that you saved in a previous step to update the Amazon EKS add-on with your custom settings. For instructions to update the add-on, see <<coredns-add-on-update>>.
