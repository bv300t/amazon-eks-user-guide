[abstract]
--
Learn about the Pod Security Policies [.noloc]`(PSP)` that Amazon EKS creates by default. PSP was deprecated in [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version `1.21` and removed in [.noloc]`Kubernetes` `1.25`.
--

The [.noloc]`Kubernetes` [.noloc]`Pod` security policy admission controller validates [.noloc]`Pod` creation and update requests against a set of rules. By default, Amazon EKS clusters ship with a fully permissive security policy with no restrictions. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/[Pod Security Policies] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` documentation.

[NOTE]
====

The `PodSecurityPolicy` ([.noloc]`PSP`) was deprecated in [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version `1.21` and removed in [.noloc]`Kubernetes` `1.25`. [.noloc]`PSPs` are being replaced with https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/[Pod Security Admission (PSA)], a built-in admission controller that implements the security controls outlined in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/[Pod Security Standards (PSS)]. PSA and PSS have both reached beta feature states, and are enabled in Amazon EKS by default. To address [.noloc]`PSP` removal in `1.25`, we recommend that you implement PSS in Amazon EKS. For more information, see link:containers/implementing-pod-security-standards-in-amazon-eks[Implementing Pod Security Standards in Amazon EKS,type="blog"] on the {aws} blog.

== Amazon EKS default [.noloc]`Pod` security policy

Amazon EKS clusters with [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version `1.13` or higher have a default [.noloc]`Pod` security policy named `eks.privileged`. This policy has no restriction on what kind of [.noloc]`Pod` can be accepted into the system, which is equivalent to running [.noloc]`Kubernetes` with the `PodSecurityPolicy` controller disabled.

[NOTE]
====

This policy was created to maintain backwards compatibility with clusters that did not have the `PodSecurityPolicy` controller enabled. You can create more restrictive policies for your cluster and for individual namespaces and service accounts and then delete the default policy to enable the more restrictive policies.

====

You can view the default policy with the following command.

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get psp eks.privileged
----

An example output is as follows.

You can view the full YAML file for the `eks.privileged` [.noloc]`Pod` security policy, its cluster role, and cluster role binding in  <<psp-install-or-restore-default,Install or restore the default Pod security policy>>.

[[psp-delete-default,psp-delete-default.title]]
== Delete the default Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Pod` security policy

If you create more restrictive policies for your [.noloc]`Pods`, then after doing so, you can delete the default Amazon EKS `eks.privileged` [.noloc]`Pod` security policy to enable your custom policies.

[IMPORTANT]
====

If you are using version `1.7.0` or later of the CNI plugin and you assign a custom [.noloc]`Pod` security policy to the `aws-node` [.noloc]`Kubernetes` service account used for the `aws-node` [.noloc]`Pods` deployed by the Daemonset, then the policy must have `NET_ADMIN` in its `allowedCapabilities` section along with `hostNetwork: true` and `privileged: true` in the policy's `spec`.

====
. Create a file named [.replaceable]`privileged-podsecuritypolicy.yaml` with the contents in the example file in <<psp-install-or-restore-default,Install or restore the default Pod security policy>>.
. Delete the YAML with the following command. This deletes the default [.noloc]`Pod` security policy, the `ClusterRole`, and the `ClusterRoleBinding` associated with it.

kubectl delete -f privileged-podsecuritypolicy.yaml

== Install or restore the default [.noloc]`Pod` security policy

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of [.noloc]`Kubernetes`, or have modified or deleted the default Amazon EKS `eks.privileged` [.noloc]`Pod` security policy, you can restore it with the following steps.

. Create a file called `privileged-podsecuritypolicy.yaml` with the following contents.
