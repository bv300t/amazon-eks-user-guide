= Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Pod` execution IAM role
:info_titleabbrev: Pod execution IAM role

include::../../attributes.txt[]

The Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Pod` execution role is required to run [.noloc]`Pods` on {aws} Fargate infrastructure.

When your cluster creates [.noloc]`Pods` on {aws} Fargate infrastructure, the components running on the Fargate infrastructure must make calls to {aws} APIs on your behalf. This is so that they can do actions such as pull container images from Amazon ECR or route logs to other {aws} services. The Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Pod` execution role provides the IAM permissions to do this.

When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a [.noloc]`Pod` execution role for the Amazon EKS components that run on the Fargate infrastructure using the profile. This role is added to the cluster's [.noloc]`Kubernetes` https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Role based access control] (RBAC) for authorization. This allows the `kubelet` that's running on the Fargate infrastructure to register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node.

[NOTE]
====

The Fargate profile must have a different IAM role than Amazon EC2 node groups.

====

[IMPORTANT]
====

The containers running in the Fargate [.noloc]`Pod` can't assume the IAM permissions associated with a [.noloc]`Pod` execution role. To give the containers in your Fargate [.noloc]`Pod` permissions to access other {aws} services, you must use <<iam-roles-for-service-accounts,IAM roles for service accounts>>.

====

Before you create a Fargate profile, you must create an IAM role with the link:aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRolePolicy.html[AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRolePolicy,type="documentation"].
[#check-pod-execution-role]
== Check for a correctly configured existing [.noloc]`Pod` execution role

You can use the following procedure to check and see if your account already has a correctly configured Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Pod` execution role. To avoid a confused deputy security problem, it's important that the role restricts access based on `SourceArn`. You can modify the execution role as needed to include support for Fargate profiles on other clusters.

. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
. In the left navigation pane, choose *Roles*.  
. On the *Roles* page, search the list of roles for *AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRole*. If the role doesn't exist, see <<create-pod-execution-role>> to create the role. If the role does exist, choose the role.
. On the *AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRole* page, do the following:
+
.. Choose *Permissions*.
.. Ensure that the *AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRolePolicy* Amazon managed policy is attached to the role.
.. Choose *Trust relationships*.
.. Choose *Edit trust policy*.
. On the *Edit trust policy* page, verify that the trust relationship contains the following policy and has a line for Fargate profiles on your cluster. If so, choose *Cancel*.

If the policy matches but doesn't have a line specifying the Fargate profiles on your cluster, you can add the following line at the top of the `ArnLike` object. Replace [.replaceable]`region-code` with the {aws} Region that your cluster is in, [.replaceable]`111122223333` with your account ID, and [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your cluster.

If the policy doesn't match, copy the full previous policy into the form and choose *Update policy*. Replace [.replaceable]`region-code` with the {aws} Region that your cluster is in. If you want to use the same role in all {aws} Regions in your account, replace [.replaceable]`region-code` with `{asterisk}`. Replace [.replaceable]`111122223333` with your account ID and [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your cluster. If you want to use the same role for all clusters in your account, replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with `{asterisk}`.


[#create-pod-execution-role]
== Creating the Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Pod` execution role

If you don't already have the Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Pod` execution role for your cluster, you can use the {aws-management-console} or the {aws} CLI to create it.



{aws-management-console}::
.. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
.. In the left navigation pane, choose *Roles*.
.. On the *Roles* page, choose *Create role*.
.. On the *Select trusted entity* page, do the following:
+
... In the *Trusted entity type* section, choose *{aws} service*.  
... From the *Use cases for other {aws} services* dropdown list, choose *EKS*.
... Choose *EKS - Fargate [.noloc]`Pod`*.
... Choose *Next*.
.. On the *Add permissions* page, choose *Next*.
.. On the *Name, review, and create* page, do the following:
+
... For *Role name*, enter a unique name for your role, such as `AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRole`.
... Under *Add tags (Optional)*, add metadata to the role by attaching tags as key-value pairs. For more information about using tags in IAM, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html[Tagging IAM resources,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.
... Choose *Create role*.
.. On the *Roles* page, search the list of roles for *AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRole*. Choose the role.

+
... Choose *Trust relationships*.
... Choose *Edit trust policy*.
.. On the *Edit trust policy* page, do the following:
+
... Copy and paste the following contents into the *Edit trust policy* form. Replace [.replaceable]`region-code` with the {aws} Region that your cluster is in. If you want to use the same role in all {aws} Regions in your account, replace [.replaceable]`region-code` with `{asterisk}`. Replace [.replaceable]`111122223333` with your account ID and [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your cluster. If you want to use the same role for all clusters in your account, replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with `{asterisk}`.
