= Amazon EKS identity-based policy examples
:info_titleabbrev: Identity-based policies

By default, IAM users and roles don't have permission to create or modify Amazon EKS resources. They also can't perform tasks using the {aws-management-console}, {aws} CLI, or {aws} API. An IAM administrator must create IAM policies that grant users and roles permission to perform specific API operations on the specified resources they need. The administrator must then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.

To learn how to create an IAM identity-based policy using these example JSON policy documents, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html#access_policies_create-json-editor[Creating policies on the JSON tab,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.

When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, the link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-principal[IAM principal,type="documentation"] that creates the cluster is automatically granted `system:masters` permissions in the cluster's role-based access control (RBAC) configuration in the Amazon EKS control plane. This principal doesn't appear in any visible configuration, so make sure to keep track of which principal originally created the cluster. To grant additional IAM principals the ability to interact with your cluster, edit the `aws-auth ConfigMap` within Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes `rolebinding` or `clusterrolebinding` with the name of a `group` that you specify in the `aws-auth ConfigMap`.

For more information about working with the ConfigMap, see <<grant-k8s-access>>.

[#security-iam-service-with-iam-policy-best-practices]
== Policy best practices

Identity-based policies determine whether someone can create, access, or delete Amazon EKS resources in your account. These actions can incur costs for your {aws} account. When you create or edit identity-based policies, follow these guidelines and recommendations:



* *Get started with {aws} managed policies and move toward least-privilege permissions* – To get started granting permissions to your users and workloads, use the _{aws} managed policies_ that grant permissions for many common use cases. They are available in your {aws} account. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining {aws} customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. For more information, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies[{aws} managed policies,type="documentation"] or link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html[{aws} managed policies for job functions,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.
* *Apply least-privilege permissions* – When you set permissions with IAM policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task. You do this by defining the actions that can be taken on specific resources under specific conditions, also known as _least-privilege permissions_. For more information about using IAM to apply permissions, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html[Policies and permissions in IAM,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.
* *Use conditions in IAM policies to further restrict access* – You can add a condition to your policies to limit access to actions and resources. For example, you can write a policy condition to specify that all requests must be sent using SSL. You can also use conditions to grant access to service actions if they are used through a specific {aws} service, such as {aws} CloudFormation. For more information, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html[IAM JSON policy elements: Condition,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.
* *Use IAM Access Analyzer to validate your IAM policies to ensure secure and functional permissions* – IAM Access Analyzer validates new and existing policies so that the policies adhere to the IAM policy language (JSON) and IAM best practices. IAM Access Analyzer provides more than 100 policy checks and actionable recommendations to help you author secure and functional policies. For more information, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-validation.html[IAM Access Analyzer policy validation,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.
* *Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)* – If you have a scenario that requires IAM users or a root user in your {aws} account, turn on MFA for additional security. To require MFA when API operations are called, add MFA conditions to your policies. For more information, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html[Configuring MFA-protected API access,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.

For more information about best practices in IAM, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html[Security best practices in IAM,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.

[#security-iam-id-based-policy-examples-console]
== Using the Amazon EKS console

To access the Amazon EKS console, an link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-principal[IAM principal,type="documentation"], must have a minimum set of permissions. These permissions allow the principal to list and view details about the Amazon EKS resources in your {aws} account. If you create an identity-based policy that is more restrictive than the minimum required permissions, the console won't function as intended for principals with that policy attached to them.

To ensure that your IAM principals can still use the Amazon EKS console, create a policy with your own unique name, such as `AmazonEKSAdminPolicy`. Attach the policy to the principals. For more information, see link:IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html[Adding and removing IAM identity permissions,type="documentation"] in the _IAM User Guide_.

[IMPORTANT]
====

The following example policy allows a principal to view information on the *Configuration* tab in the console. To view information on the *Overview* and *Resources* tabs in the {aws-management-console}, the principal also needs Kubernetes permissions. For more information, see <<view-kubernetes-resources-permissions>>.

You don't need to allow minimum console permissions for principals that are making calls only to the {aws} CLI or the {aws} API. Instead, allow access to only the actions that match the API operation that you're trying to perform.  

[#security-iam-id-based-policy-examples-view-own-permissions]
== Allow IAM users to view their own permissions

This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to view the inline and managed policies that are attached to their user identity. This policy includes permissions to complete this action on the console or programmatically using the {aws} CLI or {aws} API.

[#policy-create-cluster]
== Create a Kubernetes cluster on the {aws} Cloud

This example policy includes the minimum permissions required to create an Amazon EKS cluster named [.replaceable]`my-cluster` in the [.replaceable]`us-west-2` {aws} Region. You can replace the {aws} Region with the {aws} Region that you want to create a cluster in. If you see a warning that says *The actions in your policy do not support resource-level permissions and require you to choose `All resources`* in the {aws-management-console}, it can be safely ignored. If your account already has the [.replaceable]`AWSServiceRoleForAmazonEKS` role, you can remove the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` action from the policy. If you've ever created an Amazon EKS cluster in your account then this role already exists, unless you deleted it.
