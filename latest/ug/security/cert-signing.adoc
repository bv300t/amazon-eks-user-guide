Learn how to request and obtain X.509 certificates from the Certificate Authority (CA) using Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in Amazon EKS, including details on migrating from legacy signers, generating CSRs, approving requests, and handling certificate signing considerations before upgrading to Kubernetes 1.24.
--

The [.noloc]`Kubernetes` Certificates API automates https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509[X.509] credential provisioning. The API features a command line interface for [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API clients to request and obtain https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/[X.509 certificates] from a Certificate Authority (CA). You can use the `CertificateSigningRequest` (CSR) resource to request that a denoted signer sign the certificate. Your requests are either approved or denied before they're signed. [.noloc]`Kubernetes` supports both built-in signers and custom signers with well-defined behaviors. This way, clients can predict what happens to their CSRs. To learn more about certificate signing, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/[signing requests].

One of the built-in signers is `kubernetes.io/legacy-unknown`. The `v1beta1` API of CSR resource honored this legacy-unknown signer. However, the stable `v1` API of CSR doesn't allow the `signerName` to be set to `kubernetes.io/legacy-unknown`.

Amazon EKS version `1.21` and earlier allowed the `legacy-unknown` value as the `signerName` in `v1beta1` CSR API. This API enables the Amazon EKS Certificate Authority (CA) to generate certificates. However, in [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version `1.22`, the `v1beta1` CSR API was replaced by the `v1` CSR API. This API doesn't support the signerName of "`legacy-unknown.`" If you want to use Amazon EKS CA for generating certificates on your clusters, you must use a custom signer. It was introduced in Amazon EKS version `1.22`. To use the CSR `v1` API version and generate a new certificate, you must migrate any existing manifests and API clients. Existing certificates that were created with the existing `v1beta1` API are valid and function until the certificate expires. This includes the following:



* Trust distribution: None. There's no standard trust or distribution for this signer in a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` cluster.
* Permitted subjects: Any
* Permitted x509 extensions: Honors subjectAltName and key usage extensions and discards other extensions
* Permitted key usages: Must not include usages beyond ["key encipherment", "digital signature", "server auth"]
+
NOTE: Client certificate signing is not supported.
* Expiration/certificate lifetime: 1 year (default and maximum) 
* CA bit allowed/disallowed: Not allowed


[#csr-example]
== Example CSR generation with signerName

These steps shows how to generate a serving certificate for DNS name `myserver.default.svc` using `signerName: beta.eks.amazonaws.com/app-serving`. Use this as a guide for your own environment.

. Run the `openssl genrsa -out myserver.key 2048` command to generate an RSA private key.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
openssl genrsa -out myserver.key 2048
----
. Run the following command to generate a certificate request.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
openssl req -new -key myserver.key -out myserver.csr -subj "/CN=myserver.default.svc"
----
. Generate a `base64` value for the CSR request and store it in a variable for use in a later step.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
base_64=$(cat myserver.csr | base64 -w 0 | tr -d "
")
----
. Run the following command to create a file named `mycsr.yaml`. In the following example, `beta.eks.amazonaws.com/app-serving` is the `signerName`.
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
cat >mycsr.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: myserver
spec:
  request: $base_64
  signerName: beta.eks.amazonaws.com/app-serving
  usages:
    - digital signature
    - key encipherment
    - server auth
EOF
----
. Submit the CSR.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f mycsr.yaml
----
. Approve the serving certificate.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl certificate approve myserver
----
. Verify that the certificate was issued.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get csr myserver
----
+
An example output is as follows.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
NAME       AGE     SIGNERNAME                           REQUESTOR          CONDITION
myserver   3m20s   beta.eks.amazonaws.com/app-serving   kubernetes-admin   Approved,Issued
----
. Export the issued certificate.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get csr myserver -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}'| base64 -d > myserver.crt
----


[#csr-considerations]
== Certificate signing considerations before upgrading your cluster to [.noloc]`Kubernetes` 1.24

In [.noloc]`Kubernetes` `1.23` and earlier, `kubelet` serving certificates with unverifiable IP and DNS Subject Alternative Names (SANs) are automatically issued with unverifiable SANs. The SANs are omitted from the provisioned certificate. In `1.24` and later clusters, `kubelet` serving certificates aren't issued if a SAN can't be verified. This prevents the `kubectl exec` and `kubectl logs` commands from working.

Before upgrading your cluster to `1.24`, determine whether your cluster has certificate signing requests (CSR) that haven't been approved by completing the following steps:

. Run the following command.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get csr -A
----
+
An example output is as follows.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
NAME        AGE   SIGNERNAME                      REQUESTOR                                                  REQUESTEDDURATION   CONDITION
csr-7znmf   90m   kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving   system:node:ip-192-168-42-149.region.compute.internal      <none>              Approved
csr-9xx5q   90m   kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving   system:node:ip-192-168-65-38.region.compute.internal      <none>              Approved, Issued
----
+
If the returned output shows a CSR with a https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#kubernetes-signers[kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving] signer that's `Approved` but not `Issued` for a node, then you need to approve the request.
. Manually approve the CSR. Replace `csr-[.replaceable]``7znmf``` with your own value.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl certificate approve csr-7znmf
----

To auto-approve CSRs in the future, we recommend that you write an approving controller that can automatically validate and approve CSRs that contain IP or DNS SANs that Amazon EKS can't verify.
