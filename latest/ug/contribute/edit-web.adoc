If you want to propose change to multiple pages, or create a new docs page, use the GitHub.dev web editor. This web editor is based on the popular Visual Studio Code text editor.

== Prerequisites

* Logged in to GitHub
* Familiarity with Visual Studio Code editor
* Familiarity with Git

== Procedure

NOTE: The EKS Docs team has created a workspace file that includes suggested configurations for the editor, such as text wrapping and AsciiDoc syntax highlighting. We suggest you load this workspace file. 

. Open the https://github.dev/awsdocs/amazon-eks-user-guide/blob/mainline/eks-docs.code-workspace?workspace=true[workspace] on GitHub.dev.
** You can bookmark the URL `https://github.dev/awsdocs/amazon-eks-user-guide/blob/mainline/eks-docs.code-workspace?workspace=true`
. (First time setup only) You may be prompted to create a fork of the repo in your own GitHub account. Accept this prompt. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks[About forks] in the GitHub docs.
. (First time setup only) Accept the prompt in the bottom right to install the AsciiDoc extension. 
. Navigate to the docs content at `latest/ug`.
** Docs files are organized by their top level section. For example, pages in the "Security" chapter have source files under the "security/" directory. 
. To view a preview of a docs page, use the *Open preview to the Side* button in the top right. The icon includes a small magnifying glass. 
. Use the *Source Control* tab in the left to commit your changes. For more information, see the Visual Studio Code docs:
** https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_commit[Commit changes]
** https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_creating-pull-requests[Create a pull request] 

After you create a pull request, it will be reviewed by the docs team.
