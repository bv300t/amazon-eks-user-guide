If you want to edit multiple pages from your web browser, see <<edit-web>>.

== Prerequisites

* Docs page to change opened in web browser
* Signed into GitHub

== Procedure

. Navigate to the page you want to edit in the EKS User Guide documentation

. Look for the *Edit this page on GitHub* button located in the right sidebar of the page

. Once on GitHub, open the editor by either:
** Pressing the `e` key on your keyboard
** Clicking the pencil icon and selecting *Edit in Place* from the dropdown menu
** If you don't have the option to edit, you need to login to GitHub. Your GitHub account does not need any special permissions to suggest changes. However, internal Amazon contributors should link their GitHub profile. 

. Make your required changes to the content in the GitHub editor
** The editor provides syntax highlighting and preview capabilities
** You can use AsciiDoc markup to format your changes
** You can use `ctrl-f` to open a find/replace interface.

. (Optional) Preview your changes. 
** Use the `preview` tab to preview your changes with rich formatting.
** Use the `show diff` option to highlight changed sections. Removed sections have a red indicator in the left margin. New sections have a green indicator in the left margin.

. When finished editing, click the *Commit changes...* button at the top of the editor

. In the commit dialog:
** Verify your email address is correct
** Add a brief but descriptive commit message explaining your changes
** Optionally add a longer description if needed
** Select to create a new branch and pull request

You have created a pull request including the proposed changes.
