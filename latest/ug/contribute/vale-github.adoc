When you create a pull request to propose docs changes, multiple GitHub actions run. This includes a style check using Vale.

The style check:

* Returns an error if the string "AWS" is used instead of the variable `{aws}`
** Pull requests cannot be merged until this is resolved.
* Adds style comments to the pull request. 

== View style feedback

. Open your Pull Request
** https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-eks-user-guide/pulls[View a list of open pull requests]
. Choose the *Files changed* tab.
. Feedback from Vale is visible as line comments, that start with `[vale]`.
** Use the style feedback to identify typos, spelling errors, and awkward phrasing. 

When you update a pull request, the Vale check runs again.
