== Use Amazon Q to create content

1. Open the file you want to edit in VS Code.
2. Select the text you want to revise or the location for new content.
3. Press *Ctrl+I* or *Cmd+I*.
4. In the prompt, be specific about:
   * The type of content you need.
   * The target audience.
   * Key points to cover.
   * Desired tone and style.

== Tips
