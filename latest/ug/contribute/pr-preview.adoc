The Amazon EKS User Guide GitHub is configured to build and generate a preview of the docs site. This preview doesn't have the full {aws} theme, but it does check the content builds properly and links work.

This preview is hosted at a temporary URL by {aws} Amplify. 

== View preview

When you submit a pull request, {aws} Amplify attempts to build and deploy a preview of the content.

If the build succeeds, *aws-amplify-us-east-1* adds a comment to the pull request that has a link to the preview. Choose the link to the right of "Access this pull request here" (as called out in the screenshot with a red outline).

If the build fails, the repo admins can see the logs and provide feedback.

NOTE: If you haven't contributed before, a project maintainer may need to approve running the build.

== Preview limitations

The preview is built as a single large HTML file. It will be displayed as multiple pages when published. 

*What works:*

* Cross references (`xref`)
* Links to the internet
* Images
* Content hosted from `samples/`

*What doesn't work:*

* Links to other {aws} content, using `type="documentation"`. This is because this content doesn't exist in the preview environment.
* The attribute `{aws}` will not display properly. The value of this changes based on the environment.
