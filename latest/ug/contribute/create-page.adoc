Learn how to create a new docs page. This topic includes instructions for creating the initial page metadata, and adding the page to the guide table of contents. 

== Create page

. Navigate to the chapter directory. For example, if you want to create a new page in the "Security" section, navigate to the `latest/ug/security` directory. 
. Determine the page ID. By convention, the page ID is all lowercase and segmented with `-`. The ID of this page is `create-page`.
. Create a new file with the page ID and the `adoc` extension. For example, `create-page.adoc`.
. Insert the page metadata using this template:

== Add page to navigation

. Navigate to the parent page. The parent page of top level sections is `book.adoc`.
. At the bottom of the parent page, include the child page.
+
`include::${filename}[leveloffset=+1]`
+
_For example:_
+
`include::create-page.adoc[leveloffset=+1]`
