= Community add-ons 

include::../attributes.txt[]

You can use {aws} APIs to install community add-ons, such as the Kubernetes Metrics Server. You may choose to install community add-ons as Amazon EKS Add-ons to reduce the complexity of maintaining the software on multiple clusters. 

For example, you can use the {aws} API, CLI, or Management Console to install community add-ons. You can install a community add-on during cluster creation. 

You manage community add-ons just like existing Amazon EKS Add-ons. Community add-ons are different from existing add-ons in that they have a unique scope of support. 

NOTE: Using community add-ons is at your discretion. As part of the xref:security[shared responsibility model] between you and {aws}, you are expected to understand what you are installing into your workspace for these third party plugins. You are also responsible for the community add-ons meeting your security needs.

Community add-ons are built by {aws}. {aws} only validates community add-ons for version compatibility. For example, if you install a community add-on on a cluster, {aws} checks if it is compatible with the Kubernetes version of your cluster. 

Importantly, {aws} does not provide full support for community add-ons. {aws} supports only lifecycle operations done using {aws} APIs, such as installing add-ons or deleting add-ons. 

If you require support for a community add-on, utilize the existing project resources. For example, you may create a GitHub issue on the repo for the project.

== Determine add-on type

You can use the {aws} CLI to determine the type of an Amazon EKS Add-on. 

Use the following CLI command to retrieve information about an add-on. You can replace `metrics-server` with the name of any add-on. 

```bash
aws eks describe-addon-versions --addon-name metrics-server
```

Review the CLI output for the `owner` field.

```
{
    "addons": [
        {
            "addonName": "metrics-server",
            "type": "observability",
            "owner": "community", 
            "addonVersions": [
```

If the value of `owner` is `community`, then the add-on is a community add-on. {aws} only provides support for installing, updating, and removing the add-on. If you have questions about the functionality and operation of the add-on itself, use community resources like GitHub issues. 


== Install or update community add-on

You install or update community add-ons in the same way as other Amazon EKS Add-ons. 

* <<creating-an-add-on>>
* <<updating-an-add-on>>
* <<removing-an-add-on>>

== Available community add-ons

The following community add-ons are availalbe from Amazon EKS. 

=== Kubernetes Metrics Server

The Kubernetes Metrics Server is a scalable and efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes built-in autoscaling pipelines. It collects resource metrics from Kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver through Metrics API for use by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler.
