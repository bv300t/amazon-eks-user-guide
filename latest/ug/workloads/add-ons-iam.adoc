Grant an Amazon EKS add-on permission to call {aws} APIs. Create a Pod Identity Association for an Amazon EKS add-on.

Certain Amazon EKS add-ons need IAM roles and permissions to call {aws} APIs. For example, the Amazon VPC CNI add-on calls certain {aws} APIs to configure networking resources in your account. These add-ons need to be granted permission using IAM. More specifically, the service account of the pod running the add-on needs to be associated with an IAM role with a specific IAM policy.  

The recommended way to grant {aws} permissions to cluster workloads is using the Amazon EKS feature Pod Identities. You can use a *Pod Identity Association* to map the service account of an add-on to an IAM role. If a pod uses a service account that has an association, Amazon EKS sets environment variables in the containers of the pod. The environment variables configure the {aws} SDKs, including the {aws} CLI, to use the EKS Pod Identity credentials. For more information, see <<pod-identities>>

Amazon EKS add-ons can help manage the life cycle of pod identity associations corresponding to the add-on. For example, you can create or update an Amazon EKS add-on and the necessary pod identity association in a single API call. Amazon EKS also provides an API for retrieving suggested IAM policies.

. Confirm that <<pod-id-agent-setup,Amazon EKS pod identity agent>> is setup on your cluster.
. Determine if the add-on you want to install requires IAM permissions using the `describe-addon-versions` {aws} CLI operation. If the `requiresIamPermissions` flag is `true`, then you should use the `describe-addon-configurations` operation to determine the permissions needed by the addon. The response includes a list of suggested managed IAM policies. 
. Retrieve the name of the Kubernetes Service Account and the IAM policy using the `describe-addon-configuration` CLI operation. Evaluate the scope of the suggested policy against your security requirements.
. Create an IAM role using the suggested permissions policy, and the trust policy required by Pod Identity. For more information, see <<pod-id-association-create>>. 
. Create or update an Amazon EKS add-on using the CLI. Specify at least one pod identity association. A pod identity association is the name of a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` service account, and the ARN of the IAM role.  


* Pod identity associations created using the add-on APIs are owned by the respective add-on. If you delete the add-on, the pod identity association is also deleted. You can prevent this cascading delete by using the `preserve` option when deleting an addon using the {aws} CLI or API. You also can directly update or delete the pod identity association if necessary. Add-ons can't assume ownership of existing pod identity associations. You must delete the existing association and re-create it using an add-on create or update operation. 
* Amazon EKS recommends using pod identity associations to manage IAM permissions for add-ons. The previous method, IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA), is still supported. You can specify both an IRSA `serviceAccountRoleArn` and a pod identity association for an add-on. If the EKS pod identity agent is installed on the cluster, the `serviceAccountRoleArn` will be ignored, and EKS will use the provided pod identity association. If Pod Identity is not enabled, the `serviceAccountRoleArn` will be used. 
* If you update the pod identity associations for an existing add-on, Amazon EKS initiates a rolling restart of the add-on pods.
