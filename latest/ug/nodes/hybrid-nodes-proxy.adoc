Configure HTTP/S proxies for Amazon EKS hybrid nodes 
--

If you are using a proxy server in your on-premises environment for traffic leaving your data center or edge environment, you need to configure your operating system, `containerd`, `kubelet`, and `kube-proxy` to use your proxy server. You must configure `kube-proxy` after creating your Amazon EKS cluster. You can make the changes for your operating system, `containerd`, and the `kubelet` during the build process for your operating system images or before you run `nodeadm init` on each hybrid node.

== Node-level configuration

The configurations in this section must be applied in your operating system images or before running `nodeadm init` on each hybrid node.

=== `containerd` proxy configuration

`containerd` is the default container management runtime for Kubernetes. If you are using a proxy for internet access, you must configure `containerd` so it can pull the container images required by Kubernetes and Amazon EKS.

Create a file on each hybrid node called `http-proxy.conf` in the `/etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d` directory with the following contents. Replace `proxy-domain` and `port` with the values for your environment.

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost"
----

==== `containerd` configuration from user data

The `containerd.service.d` directory will need to be created for this file. You will need to reload systemd to pick up the configuration file without a reboot. In AL2023, the service will likely already be running when your script executes, so you will also need to restart it.

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d
echo '[Service]' > /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d
echo 'Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#"' >> /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d
echo 'Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#"' >> /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d
echo 'Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost"' >> /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart containerd
----

=== `kubelet` proxy configuration

`kubelet` is the Kubernetes node agent that runs on each Kubernetes node and is responsible for managing the node and pods running on it. If you are using a proxy in your on-premises environment, you must configure the `kubelet` so it can communicate with your Amazon EKS cluster's public or private endpoints.

Create a file on each hybrid node called `http-proxy.conf` in the `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/` directory with the following content. Replace `proxy-domain` and `port` with the values for your environment.

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost"
----

==== `kubelet` configuration from user data

The `kubelet.service.d` directory must be created for this file. You will need to reload systemd to pick up the configuration file without a reboot. In AL2023, the service will likely already be running when your script executes, so you will also need to restart it.

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
echo '[Service]' > /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
echo 'Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#"' >> /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
echo 'Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#"' >> /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
echo 'Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost"' >> /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart containerd
----

=== Operating system proxy configuration

If you are using a proxy for internet access, you must configure your operating system to be able to pull the hybrid nodes dependencies from your operating systems' package manager.

*Ubuntu*

. Configure `snap` to use your proxy with the following commands:
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
sudo snap set system proxy.https=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#
sudo snap set system proxy.http=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#
----

. To enable proxy for `apt`, create a file called `apt.conf` in the `/etc/apt/` directory. Replace proxy-domain and port with the values for your environment.
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#";
----

*Amazon Linux 2023 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux*

. Configure `yum` to use your proxy. Create a file `/etc/yum.conf` with the proxy-domain and port values for your environment.
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
proxy=http://[.replaceable]#proxy-domain:port#
----

== Cluster wide configuration

The configurations in this section must be applied after you create your Amazon EKS cluster and before running `nodeadm init` on each hybrid node.

=== kube-proxy proxy configuration

Amazon EKS automatically installs `kube-proxy` on each hybrid node as a DaemonSet when your hybrid nodes join the cluster. `kube-proxy` enables routing across services that are backed by pods on Amazon EKS clusters. To configure each host, `kube-proxy` requires DNS resolution for your Amazon EKS cluster endpoint. 

. Edit the `kube-proxy` DaemonSet with the following command
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
kubectl -n kube-system edit ds kube-proxy
----
+
This will open the `kube-proxy` DaemonSet definition on your configured editor.

. Add the environment variables for `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`. Note the `NODE_NAME` environment variable should already exist in your configuration. Replace `proxy-domain` and `port` with values for your environment.
+
